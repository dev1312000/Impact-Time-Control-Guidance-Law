### ðŸ“š Abstract

> *There exists many closed-form guidance law with impact angle control based on linearization. Similar concept is used here to derive impact time control guidance (ITCG) law using optimal control theory, in nonlinear form. The objetive of this guidance law is to use it for application in salvo attack, where multiple missiles hit the target simultaneourly at **desired impact time**, confusing the CIWS (Closed-in Weapon System) of battleship. This guidance law preserves the form of Proportional Navigation Guidance (PNG) at its core with modification to achieve desired impact time.*
